# Situation

At the State Department of Infrastructure there is a growing amount of data about ongoing and finished construction contracts, along with planned projects and procurement and/or licitations still in progress. This is managed through different ways, such as documents, excel files, a state wide website that takes user inputs, apps and others, which can become overwhelming to keep track of due to its changing nature.

# Task

In order to keep up with information about the contracts in a simpler manner, I was tasked with creating a dashboard to display the most relevant data for different departments containing a multitude of filters.

# Action

I, alongside my team, created an intuitive and visually pleasing report with easy and accessible data displaying all information previously only available in a series of different data sources. I researched ways to make it more interactive in a seamless manner by using bookmarks, allowing users to navigate the pages entirely through buttons in the dashboard screen instead of simply advancing pages in a pre-established order.

With over 20 pages and a slow loading time, the initial page leads to several specific topics that attends to different needs, such as ongoing contracts, finished constructions, financial information, highway and road construction, overall views and others. 

Lateral menus for both page navigation and page-specific filtering frees up room for data visualization through graphs and tables.

The extensive use of bookmarks allow the complex information to flow clearly, with a level of interactiveness that takes Power BI to another level. All bookmarks and graphics are also organized to make sure any other users with access to edit can navigate through the file without confusion.

# Results

The dashboard is used by all managers and chief officers in the State Department of Infrastructure, allowing for quick confirmations of current data for all departments. Due to the amount of data displayed, it is also utilized by the State Governor during meetings since it encompasses all work executed in the state and has since inspired other state departments to manage their information through some sort of dashboard, which aligns with the goals of having data completeness, accuracy and integrity in government work.
